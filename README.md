# HyperShopper

Companies such as Supreme use a limited supply to create demand and urge customers to buy their products and this exclusivity plays a significant role in Supreme's success. In fact, popular items on Supreme usually sell out in under ten seconds! HyperShopper is a software application programmed to buy products as soon as they are released. Currently, HyperShopper supports Supreme.com and Nike's sneaker app, SNKRS.
